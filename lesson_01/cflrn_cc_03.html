			<div id="content">
				<p> Comments From Learner provides a valuable opportunity for Instructional Designers (IDs) and Content Developers to gather feedback from learners based on their learning experience. Often times, this element is used during the first run or pilot of a program or at the end of a lesson, module or course. Learners may be asked a series of questions or requested to provide comments on their experience. The feedback provided by learners allows the IDs and developers to make changes and adjustments to improve the learning experience.</p>
				<p><em> In order to fully use this element, a Learning Management System (LMS) must provide a mechanism for reporting on any comments provided by the learner. There is currently no requirement for an LMS to provide such a mechanism. Content Developers or providers should work with their respective LMS (if known) to see if this capability or a similar capability is implemented.</em></p>
