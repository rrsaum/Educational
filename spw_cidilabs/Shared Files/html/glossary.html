				<dl>
					<dt>Annotation:</dt> <dd>An explanatory note; a commentary made during the learner's time in the content.</dd>
					<dt>Assessment:</dt> <dd>A test, quiz or other method of determining the learner's knowledge or skills.</dd>
					<dt>Asset:</dt> <dd>An electronic file representing media, text, image, audio, etc. that does not communicate with the LMS. The Asset may be a single file or a file made up of other assets.</dd>
					<dt>Audio Captioning:</dt> <dd>A series of words that communicate dialogue.</dd>
					<dt>Bookmarking:</dt> <dd>A marker in the content.</dd>
					<dt>Completion:</dt> <dd>A predetermined point at which the SCO is considered finished or complete.</dd>
					<dt>Correct Response:</dt> <dd>Interaction Data that provides a collection of possible correct responses for the interaction.</dd>
					<dt>Fill In:</dt>  <dd>An Interactions Type that requires the learner to supply a short response; the required response is typically one or two words. A Fill In interaction can be designed to have the learner provide multiple Fill In responses.</dd>
					<dt>Interaction Description:</dt> <dd>Interaction Data that provides a brief informative description about the interaction.</dd>
					<dt>Interaction Identifier:</dt> <dd>Interaction Data that provides a unique label to distinguish one interaction from another.</dd>
					<dt>Interaction Journaling:</dt>  <dd>A method for the SCO to record information each time the learner responds to an interaction, including each time a learner changes an answer to an interaction.</dd>
					<dt>Interaction Objective Id:</dt> <dd>Interaction Data that provides a unique label for the objective associated with the interaction. Multiple objective identifiers can be associated with a given interaction.</dd>
					<dt>Interaction Status Tracking:</dt>  <dd>A method for the SCO to store only the latest information about the interaction because it updates any previously recorded data.</dd>
					<dt>Interaction Timestamp:</dt>  <dd>Interaction Data that provides a record of the point in time when the interaction was first presented to the learner.</dd>
					<dt>Interactions:</dt>  <dd>Responses to individual questions or tasks that are intended to be recorded by the SCO.</dd>
					<dt>Latency:</dt>  <dd>Interaction Data that provides the time elapsed between the time the interaction was made available to the learner and the time of the first response.</dd>
					<dt>Launch:</dt> <dd>The action that occurs when the SCO is delivered to the learner by the LMS.</dd>
					<dt>Learner Attempt:</dt> <dd>A tracked effort by a learner to satisfy the requirements of a learning activity that uses a content object.  An attempt may span one or more learner sessions and may be suspended between learner sessions.</dd>
					<dt>Learner Response:</dt>  <dd>Interaction Data that provides information generated when a learner responds to the interaction.</dd>
					<dt>Learner Session:</dt> <dd>An uninterrupted period of time during which a learner is accessing a content object.</dd>
					<dt>Learning Management System (LMS):</dt>  <dd>A suite of functionalities designed to deliver, track, report on and manage learning content, learner progress and learner interactions. The term &quot;LMS&quot; can apply to very simple content management systems, or highly complex enterprise-wide distributed environments. </dd>
					<dt>Likert:</dt>  <dd>An Interaction Type that requires the learner to select from a discrete set of choices on a scale.</dd>
					<dt>Location:</dt> <dd>A point in the content.</dd>
					<dt>Long Fill In:</dt>  <dd>An Interaction Type that requires the learner to supply a response in the form of several words to multiple paragraphs. A Long Fill In can be used for interactions that would require responses in the form of essay, code snippets, etc.</dd>
					<dt>Mastery:</dt> <dd>The achievement of a predetermined goal or score to satisfy completion of a subject.</dd>
					<dt>Matching:</dt>  <dd>An Interaction Type that requires the learner to associate related items from two sets or lists of information.</dd>
					<dt>Maximum Score:</dt>  <dd>The highest score a learner can achieve within a particular SCO.</dd>
					<dt>Minimum Score:</dt>  <dd>The lowest score a learner can achieve by completing a particular SCO.</dd>
					<dt>Mode:</dt> <dd>A particular way the SCO may be presented to the learner.</dd>
					<dt>Multiple Choice:</dt>  <dd>An Interaction Type in the form of a question or task with two or more predefined selections that the learner may choose from.</dd>
					<dt>Performance:</dt>  <dd>An Interaction Type that requires the learner to perform a task with multiple steps.</dd>
					<dt>Project Requirements:</dt> <dd> Conditions, determined by the client, project team, or standards that must be met in the design and development of the content.</dd>
					<dt>Raw Score:</dt>  <dd>The learner&rsquo;s score for the SCO, within the range of the minimum and maximum values.</dd>
					<dt>Result:</dt>  <dd>Interaction Data that provides a judgment about the correctness of the learner&rsquo;s response.</dd>
					<dt>Run-Time Environment (RTE) Book:</dt>  <dd>A SCORM book that describes the Learning Management System (LMS) requirements for managing the run-time environment (i.e., content launch process, communication between content and LMSs and standardized data model elements used for passing information about the learner). The RTE covers the requirements of SCOs and their use of the API and the SCORM Run-Time Environment Data Model.</dd>
					<dt>Scaled Score:</dt>  <dd>The learner&rsquo;s score, valued on a scale from &ndash;1.0 to 1.0.    </dd>
					<dt>Score:</dt>  <dd>SCORM RTE data model element used to measure a learner&rsquo;s performance or achievement of learning objectives.</dd>
					<dt>SCORM Run-Time Environment (RTE) Data Model:</dt>  <dd>A standard set of data elements used to define the information being communicated, such as, the status of the learning resource. In its simplest form, the data model defines elements that both the LMS and SCO are expected to &quot;know about.&quot; The LMS must maintain the state of required data elements across sessions, and the learning content must utilize only these predefined data elements if reuse across multiple systems is to occur.</dd>
					<dt>Sequencing:</dt>	 <dd>An Interaction Type that requires the learner to identify a logical order for items in a list.</dd>
					<dt>Sharable Content Object (SCO):</dt>	<dd>Represents a collection of one or more Assets that include a specific launchable asset that utilizes the SCORM Run-Time Environment to communicate with Learning Management Systems (LMSs). A SCO represents the lowest level of granularity of learning resources that can be tracked by an LMS using the SCORM Run-Time Environment.</dd>
					<dt>Sharable Content Object Refenece Model (SCORM<span style="font-size:x-small; vertical-align:text-top">&reg;</span>):</dt>  <dd>Defines a Web-based learning &quot;Content Aggregation Model&quot; and &quot;Run-Time Environment&quot; for learning objects. At its simplest, it is a model that references a set of interrelated technical specifications and guidelines designed to meet the DoD&rsquo;s high-level requirements for e-learning content and systems.</dd>
					<dt>Suspended Learner Attempt/Session:</dt> <dd> The result when the learner attempt or session has stopped and is incomplete.</dd>
<dt>Threshold:</dt> <dd>The point that must be exceeded to begin producing a given effect, such as completion.</dd>
<dt>Timestamp:</dt> <dd>A time notation indicating when an event occurred.</dd>

					<dt>True/False:</dt>  <dd>An Interaction Type in which the learner response is a state that contains that values of &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.</dd>
					<dt>Version:</dt> <dd>A variation of an earlier type.</dd>
<dt>Weight:</dt>  <dd>Value assigned to an interaction and used to calculate a score.</dd>					
<dt>Weighting:</dt>  <dd>Interaction Data that provides the value for the interactions used to compute a total score for an assessment. The weights typically are used to explain the effect of an interaction on a total score but are not intended to be used by systems other than the content to compute the score.</dd>
